Hello world! 
This repository shares my method of getting the first, second and third numbers for the computer math step in the terminus ee.
Basically all this program does is take the X, Y and Z values inputed by the user and does the necessary math to output the three numbers. Im new to C coding so let me know if you see anything wrong with the code and/or logic.
Thank you and enjoy.
